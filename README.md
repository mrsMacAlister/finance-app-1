## Personal Finance Web Application

This app lets a user track finances, set savings goals and debt payoff by logging in and only seeing their own data.
It is built in **React**, styled with **Sass**, and **Firebase** is used for authentication, database and storage.

*Additional features and code optimization are yet to follow.*
